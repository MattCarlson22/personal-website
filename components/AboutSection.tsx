                    Hello! My name is Matt, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at ASU and an intern at Fyresite in Tempe, AZ.
                    I have experience in Java, Javascript, C, C++, and Python, along with some experience in the React and NextJS frameworks.
                    I am also quite versed in Linux, and have been a user since 2018. My expected graduation date is May 2026.
